Ancient Egypt was a really interesting civilization and had a very unique religion. A goal of mine was to visit the pyramids and see the valley of the kings which I did on my trip to Egypt.

Cars use honking as a way to communicate their presence to avoid scraps and collisions, so the sound of car horns never stops.\", \"The second place I went to is Luxor which is situated close to the valley of kings. I had my first hot air ballon ride over the valley of kings which was a really cool experience. Seeing the sun rise from hundreds of feet in the air among the other hot air balloons was breathtaking.
